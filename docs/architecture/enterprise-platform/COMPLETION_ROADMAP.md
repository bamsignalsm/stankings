# Enterprise Completion Roadmap

**Program:** Shared Enterprise Platform Completion  
**Parent:** [SHARED_ENTERPRISE_PLATFORM_PROGRAM.md](../SHARED_ENTERPRISE_PLATFORM_PROGRAM.md)  
**Date:** 2026-07-22  

Dependency-driven milestones. Order minimizes rework and maximizes contract stability.

> **Amendment (approved):** M2A Enterprise Event Runtime sits immediately after Identity advances and **before** Passport, so every subsequent capability shares one event model.

| **Complexity** | L |
| **Consumer impact** | Unlocks lawful cross-product data sharing patterns |

### M5 — Passport Runtime (P0)

| | |
|--|--|
| **Objective** | Passport eight gates |
| **Prerequisites** | M2; M4 strongly recommended before production sharing |
| **Deliverables** | Credential lifecycle, evidence framework, linking to Identity, persistence, tests, docs |
| **Validation** | G1–G8; no OAuth scope creep unless separately approved |
| **Complexity** | L |
| **Consumer impact** | Primary cross-product credential surface |
| **Status (2026-07-22)** | **✅ Complete (code)** — `assessPassportEightGates().complete === true`; migration **not applied** pending architectural review |

### M6 — Trust Runtime (T0)

| **Prerequisites** | M2, M5 |
| **Deliverables** | Events, policy engine, assessments, evidence refs, history, persistence, tests, docs |

### M9 — Governance Runtime (G0)

| | |
|--|--|
| **Objective** | Policy runtime + feature gates |
| **Prerequisites** | Core data planes M2–M7 stable enough |
| **Deliverables** | Policy evaluation interface, feature gates, compliance rule hooks bound to Constitution refs |
| **Validation** | G1–G8 for scoped policy engine (not rewriting Constitution) |

### M10 — SDK / Consumer Package (K0)

### M11–M13 — Consumer integrations (X1–X3)

| Milestone | Consumer | Prerequisites | Complexity |
|-----------|----------|---------------|------------|
| M11 | BamSignal | M10 + required caps complete | L (integration) |
| M12 | Yike | M10 + required caps complete | L |
| M13 | BayRight | M10 + required caps complete | L |

**Consumer impact:** First real production consumption. Platform changes after this require compatibility discipline.

### M14 — Future companies (X4)

Times, Hotel, Shodis, and later entities register platforms and adopt SDK — no shared capability forks.

---

## Complexity key

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| M | Days to ~1–2 weeks engineering |
| L | Multi-week, multi-module |
| XL | Multi-sprint domain |

Estimates are relative, not calendar commitments.

---

## What “platform complete” looks like

- M0–M10 done against eight gates  
- Discovery reports production readiness for Identity, Passport, Trust, Consent, Explainability, Registry read, Platform health  
- SDK published; fixture consumer green  
- Completion estimate → **100% under durable definition**  
- Only then X1+ proceed as engineering workstreams

---

## Near-term recommendation (next implementation sprint after review)

**Close Identity G3** (durable `IdentityStore` adapter after supabase verify) and remaining Identity gates, while keeping **event model** as the required emission pattern for all new runtimes.

Do **not** start Passport executable work until Identity clears eight gates (or an explicit waiver documents remaining Identity gaps).
